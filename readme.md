Application 1: Hello World
  The first application that says Hello in a separate window.

Problems
*********
1. Can't find kits.
  Go to Options -> Build & Run -> Qt Version -> check if the file selected is correct, if not select qmake file from /usr/bin/qmake-qt5 (for linux)
  After this, go to Kits -> Qt Version -> see if correct version is selected.
